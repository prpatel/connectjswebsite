We&#39;ll cover these topics and more in this talk, helping attendees get past Git novice and on their way to Git master. The talk will being with a short overview of git fundamentals, but quickly jump into more advanced concepts. We&#39;ll cover branching, commit amending, stashing, cherry-picking, and yes, merging versus rebasing. You might not be a Git guru after one conference session, but you will have a better understanding of how to play nicely with others in the same Git repository and how to fix common (and not so common) issues in Git.

  </div>
  <div class="modal-body panel-body-session">
    Behavior Driven Development is a proven way to deliver higher quality code to meet your business’ requirements in less time and you can add it to any agile processes (like Scrum) that does not specify how software should be developed.

In this session we’ll look at two BDD frameworks; Cucumber and Jasmine. Cucumber is a tool that lets you turn user stories into executable specifications that run every time you check in a code change, so you can verify that what you’re delivering meets the business’ acceptance criteria. Jasmine can be used to write lower level specifications that describe the services needed to make the executable specifications pass. You can use it to write unit tests that ensure the code you’ve written behaves the way you expect. 

Using them together leads to some nice results. You only write code needed to meet the user acceptance criteria, your code behaves the way you expect it to, and you can safely refactor your code to improve clarity, simplify its structure, or meet any other metric you deem necessary. This focused development results in highly cohesive, loosely coupled code, which means it’s easier to debug, maintain and enhance. Now isn’t that a tasty treat?

    Becoming an expert coder involves much more than learning the coolest new framework or becoming a design pattern ninja.  Becoming an expert coder is about passion and craftsmanship. In this two-part series we will dive into Software Craftsmanship, what it is and how it has not only influenced but also refactored our industry and trade. We wont stop there, we will discuss how to grow beyond being a commodity coder to being mentored and mentoring others, who the mentors are, and how to take ownership of your coding career.  Finally we will look at what often makes JS code suk and the often ignored but essential disciplines of master software craftsmen and how these apply to JS coders.

    Frequently, designers and engineers tend to run in their own circles and speak their own distinct languages. Interactions between the 2 teams tend to follow a prescribed, limited path: design creates mocks for a planned UI change, engineering implements the mocks and deploys the new UI to the customer. But experience has shown that keeping design and engineering engaged throughout the product development cycle leads to far more coherent, impactful result. Josh Teague (lead designer at FullStory) and Stephanie Brubaker (senior engineer at FullStory) will be sharing lessons from their own experience on how design and engineering teams can work together to create breakthrough products.

    The biggest sources of code complexity are state &amp; control flow. Loops, conditionals, try/catch blocks, callbacks, &amp; mutable variable assignment is one way to ensure such complexity. By contrast, if we have a composable set of pieces that plug together, we can “dot chain” a single expression for which our data flows through. We’ll examine techniques from functional programming, borrow some moves from OO, and write blocks of dead-simple to understand code.

    Looking at the expanse of developing a new product there are hundreds of small mechanisms that need to be in place as you take an idea from prototype to production.  This talk is a look at using Ember to race up the canyon walls to the plateau of maintaining a production application.  Aside from developing a maintainable, useful, and working application, the development team will need to think about the following: build systems and deployment, wireframes to components, simultaneous API and client development, feature spikes with 3rd party libraries, and post-launch maintenance and education.  While examining two start-up projects, I will explore these topics and how Ember helps to provide streamlined solutions.

    There is no doubt that Angular is now mainstream. That made it easier for you to convince the powers-that-be to let you select Angular for your project. You&#39;ve done a small but successful POC and now your &#39;big&#39; project has been green lighted to kick off next month. Your team is jazzed but as you start to plan out the real work, you begin to realize that there are many aspects inherrent to large Angular projects that have no &#39;out of the box&#39; answers.

Stack overflow can only contribute &#39;it depends&#39; answers that leave you more confused than before you read them. And now the panic starts to seep in, killing your buzz. Never fear! In this session, we will explore a variety of ways to architect your project and structure your code. We will look at the pros and cons of each option and discuss when trigger points for choosing each.

    Angular 2 is one of the most discussed technologies during the past year. There are plenty of rumors about the rocket science powering the framework and its exceptional scalability, portability and speed.

A lot of features make Angular unique - runtime generation of VM friendly code that takes advantage of inline-caching, cross-platform portability, facades which allows the same code to be transformed to both Dart and TypeScript, tree-shakable architecture, etc.

Although all this sounds curious, it is hard to explore each individual concept by taking a deep dive at the Angular&#39;s codebase which exceeds 100k lines of code. In this talk I will synthesize some of the most interesting things that I discovered during my contribution to the project and involvement in the Angular community.

    If you’ve built an iOS app, you know about the MVC pattern, and where UIViewController fits into it. View controllers have become the workhorses of CocoaTouch, and are all too easy to over-burden.

The increasingly popular Model View ViewModel pattern is all about giving view controllers a break, and separating presentation logic from UI. The advent of watchOS and tvOS has made this a great time to learn how and why this is more important than ever.

Through the lens of real-world problems and solutions, we’ll break MVVM down into some simple but effective architectural decisions that can help you keep the ever-blurring lines of the MVC pattern just a little clearer. No dependencies or frameworks, just good patterns and strong architecture.

    GraphQL&#39;s flexibility has made it an intriguing and necesary choice for frontend developers. These developers seem to understand the benefits of using GraphQL before their backend counterparts, but have a hard time selling the benefits in a way that causes the backend team to grasp. Most concerns from backend developers are around the GraphQL structure, reimplemenation of existing logic and deployment. What if you could deploy GraphQL without the need to deploy and manage entire servers? In this talk we&#39;ll explore using GraphQL in a serverless context with AWS Lambda, using the Serverless framework. We&#39;ll look at the pros and cons of deploying GraphQL in such an architecture.

    APIs are the backbone of modern web applications. Whether they be used as a access point for AJAX queries, mobile apps, 3rd party integrations or just general data feeds, your applications’ API often needs the ability to access everything. Securing the API consequently is essential to the security of your application. This talk will cover the various types of APIs common in web applications, the security issues relevant with the various API types and methods for securing your APIs, and slowing down the hackers.

ADR (Action-Domain-Responder) represents a refinement of generic MVC as an application architecture specifically tuned to the web. In this talk, we will discuss various patterns of overall application architecture, including MVC, MVP, PAC, DCI, RMR, and others. We will find out how the ADR pattern arises from generic MVC, and how it provides a better description of how web applications actually work. Finally, we will go over examples of how to architect an ADR application, as well as how to convert from an MVC architecture to an ADR one.

The real time aspect and a number of lesser known, powerful features (such as transactions) make it possible to create a multiplayer gaming experience as well.

In this session, we&#39;ll twist the traditional rock-paper-scissors into a web based, multiplayer  happy-surprised-angry game using your facial expressions and a web-cam. We’ll use both old and new Firebase features to keep track of online players, synchronize game state across multiple connections, create chat rooms, and match players together for game play.

    Not just another &quot;Progressive Web Apps&quot; talk.

Compared to native apps, mobile websites have historically been at a disadvantage: no installation, no push notifications, and they only work when you&#39;re online.

This year, that changed.

This session examines how the new Service Worker, Push, and App Manifest specifications fill the gaps between web and native. But this isn&#39;t just another &quot;Progressive Web App&quot; talk; instead, we&#39;ll dicuss the new APIs individually, emphasizing their flexibility and countering the one-size-fits-all hype.

This talk will cover:

1. How to use Service Workers as a programmable proxy/cache for your website, which allows you to make resources available offline.

2. How to use Push to send notifications to your website&#39;s users, even when they don&#39;t have your site open.

3. How to use a Web App Manifest to control your site&#39;s presentation and installability.

We&#39;ll also discuss how, taken together, they allow us to create mobile web experiences that are virtually indistinguishable from native. Or not. How you use these specs really is up to you.

  <div class="modal-body panel-body-session">
    Apache Cordova is one of the most popular frameworks for cross-platform mobile development. Web developers can build apps for iOS, Android, and Windows based on the same frameworks they use for the Web by using a shared codebase. However, the methods for improving mobile app performance can be different from those web developers use for web apps. Doris Chen outlines what impacts “native performance” and explains how the startup time, as well as the overhead of resume, memory, communication, and the Web, can all contribute to the performance of Cordova apps. To build Cordova apps that perform well, it’s important to understand how to avoid common pitfalls and how to use the technologies in the most efficient ways. Doris introduces tools for performance tests and demonstrates how to measure mobile app performance by using diagnostic tools for different platforms. Doris also shares practical tips for building faster Cordova apps by exploring Document Object Model (DOM) complexity, animation techniques, and memory management.

    Android has been the most widely installed mobile operating system in the world since 2013. It’s an awesome platform and its open source code, which can be used on various different devices, has made it a popular choice for many projects and applications. That said, for developers, Android does have one Achilles heel: Java. The release of Kotlin 1.0 offers a compelling alternative. But, it is a good idea to use it? Let’s take a tour of Kotlin with code samples, cat pictures, and a little bit of live coding. Learn how to put your codebase on a diet and improve its readability by converting your existing classes to Kotlin. See how you can improve your code quality by using the built-in null safety, and how to make unit testing more pleasurable by using the Spek framework. Along the way, we’ll share tips and tricks for using Kotlin in production apps. By the end of this talk you’ll have enough knowledge to confidently start to use Kotlin in your Android projects.

    Node.js is quickly capturing the programming world not just in web, but in IoT, drones, robots and embedded systems. This talk dives deep into the core mechanisms of the Node.js platform and some of its most interesting features. We will brush-up on the core concept which enables the non-blocking I/O. We will discuss streams and buffers, and/or effective ways to work with data. Then we&#39;ll have a crash course about event emitters. We will level up our knowledge on how to fork like a pro. We will also discuss AsyncWrap, Domain and uncaughtException. We will also dive into to the core and you&#39;ll learn writing your own C++ addons. If you are a geek like most of us, then you’d appreciate this presentation. You’ll become more confident in the internals of Node.js and understand how certain things work.

    Grunt and Gulp are the heavyweights in the JavaScript build tool landscape. These tools can automate almost anything you find yourself doing repeatedly in a project, from minifying and concatenating source files, to running tests or compiling code. But the question is, do you need them? npm’s script directive can do everything that these build tools can, more succinctly, more elegantly, with less package dependencies and less maintenance overhead. In this session I will discuss what npm is capable of as a build tool.

AngularJS is the incredibly popular framework for building single-page web applications. Version 2.0 is a major leap from the 1.x version designed to address shortcomings in the original 5+ year old framework and to embrace modern browsers and language features. It is being written using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that allows you to build code using next generation features and compile it to JavaScript that will run on current browsers. In this session Jeremy Likness goes hands-on to show you how to set up your environment and build your first application while teaching you about the advantages of the framework and language based on his years of in-the-field experience architecting enterprise Angular applications.

    Everyone knows fast sites provide a better UX and have happy users which generate more revenue. But since there are literally hundreds of issues that could be slowing down your pages, How do you figure out (and fix) the ones that are hurting your business most?

Using data from the Top IR200 retail sites, Billy will show attendees how to:

-Gather historical user data via RUM
-Correlate load times with conversions
-Determine which pages in your site are most impacting your business goals.
-Show the top 10 issues that create the biggest bounce rates on the top retail sites on the web.

No doubt you’ve encountered scores of lists outlining the top performance issues faced by sites. Unlike those lists, this list is grounded in a study of revenue/business impact. Using this approach, you can focus on fixing the performance defects that are hurting you most on the pages that matter the most.

    For years, we’ve relied on preprocessors to simplify CSS development, but the time is coming when we won’t need this anymore. Variables, mixins, mathematic calculations, color manipulation, and nested selectors are all in the official specification, at various stages of development. Nearly every feature provided by SASS and LESS is coming to the browser. Some of it has already arrived. Some of it is even more powerful than the preprocessor you are used to.

In this talk, I’ll show you how all these features work. And I’ll show you how, using the PostCSS processor, you can transpile this future syntax into code you can use today. Come take a glimpse at what the future of CSS holds.

                                          AngularJS is the incredibly popular framework for building single-page web applications. Version 2.0 is a major leap from the 1.x version designed to address shortcomings in the original 5+ year old framework and to embrace modern browsers and language features. It is being written using TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that allows you to build code using next generation features and compile it to JavaScript that will run on current browsers. In this session Jeremy Likness goes hands-on to show you how to set up your environment and build your first application while teaching you about the advantages of the framework and language based on his years of in-the-field experience architecting enterprise Angular applications.

React.js is a view library from Facecbook for building performant user-interfaces in JavaScript. In this session, we'll explore React.js and understand why it's a great step forward for building complex UI's that run fast. We'll code up an example web application using React.js and step through the basics of using the library while discussing concepts like the virtual DOM and components.

This is a HAND-ON WORKSHOP, INTRODUCTORY LEVEL. Please come with a laptop, and if possible, with the software needed pre-installed (Instructions below). We'll cover these topics - both in code and in discussion format, and do as many as we can in the time alloted

Functional programming is all the rage these days, but our codebases, libraries, and built-in methods are predominately Object-Oriented. Using OO syntax with functional constructs, we can write in a style compatible with either paradigm and enjoy the benefits of both. We will explore disjunction, monoids, monads, and other algebraic abstractions to produce highly composable, safer, and simpler code.

This fast-paced workshop shows you how to take advantage of Swift features to write more robust code that is easier to reason about. We’ll spend a good part of the day looking at functional programming and playing with map, filter, reduce, and flatmap but we will also create instances of classes, structs, and enums. We’ll explore how your iOS app architecture may change when you embrace idiomatic Swift. One of the strengths of Swift is that it can borrow the best from a multitude of paradigms. We’ll look at how to successfully weave together OO and functional code into a readable and flexible architecture and focus on protocol oriented programming.

From transitions to loaders, user interfaces are coming alive with motion like we've never seen before. Animation, or “motion design,” has become an essential part of the designer’s toolkit for expressing fundamental interaction design principles.
In this workshop, the instructor will show how the aims of interaction design are fulfilled through animation and will discuss what to consider when using animation in your own designs.
Through discussion and hands-on implementation, attendees will learn to design and prototype animation using tools like Keynote, Principle, Pixate, or Invision.

                                          The EcmaScript standard is now on a yearly release cycle. With ES6 complete and ES2016 ratified, we have a ton of awesome new features to use in our daily software development. In this training, we'll learn about the features you're likely to use and benefit from on a day-to-day basis. In the afternoon, we'll take an existing application and update it to leverage these features using with modern tools like Babel. My goal is that after this training, you'll be able to go back to your projects and add these tools so you can write ES.next code today.

In this one-day intensive course, we will dive deep into core mechanisms of the JS language, probably more than you ever have before. Our goal is to not merely understand what these things do, but how and why. 

We will cover: 

• nested lexical scope 
• hoisting 
• closures 
• modules 
• 'this' keyword 
• common oo patterns 
• object prototypes 
• delegation vs inheritance
