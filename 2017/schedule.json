The promise is simple: packaged reusable code that makes powerful widgets like grids, toolbars, menus, smart input controls, panels, media players, charts, graphs, trees, image viewers, and so on, easy to integrate into applications.\r\n\r\nOn the web, frameworks such as ASP.NET, JSF, Tapestry, Wicket, GWT, and Vaadin take advantage of component architectures, and there is no shortage of JavaScript/HTML5 widget libraries such as YUI, KendoUI, jQuery UI, Bootstrap, ExtJS, and so on. Each of these frameworks allows developers to build their own custom components, but those components won\u2019t work outside of the framework. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if there were a standard way to build a UI component that runs in a browser? A component model that is part of the open web?\r\n\r\nFinally, there is: Web Components, an emerging standard from the Web Applications Working Group (WAWG). Web Components consists of five different standards: Templates, Decorators,\r\nCustom Elements, Shadow DOM, and Imports. Together, these standards allow you to build custom widgets with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS that can be used just like native HTML elements.\r\n\r\nSince the standards are not fully supported in all browsers, you need a library to support them in non-compliant browsers. Google\u2019s Polymer does just this, and more.\r\n\r\nCome to this workshop to learn about these exciting new technologies hands-on.","persons":[{"id":160,"full_public_name":"Kito Mann","abstract":"Kito D.

Web applications are no longer being built to cater to human interaction, but now must adapt to be able to handle multiple interfaces for machines and humans alike. This new requirement has placed a dramatic emphasis on API interfaces and has ushered in a new development methodology called API\u00adfirst development. With this new mandate, developers now must concern themselves with their API platform before they build the multitude of disparate applications that depend on it.\r\nThese applications must also be built differently, where status quo techniques are no longer good enough. We are now in a time where the web application server should no longer be responsible for serving application interfaces, but instead must only support external applications through a stateless RESTful API. This method finally releases the application from the confines of the server and allows it to interface to multiple Micro services to become a stand\u00adalone multi\u00adservice application.\r\nWith this shift, we have also seen a rise in many different technologies that support this movement. Technologies such as Angular.js and React provide developers a way to create front\u00adend applications that are performant and robust, while on the server side, we have seen a rise of JavaScript based frameworks rooted in the Node.js community that enable web application servers to support a large amount of concurrent applications. Application sessions are also evolving as new token based authentication (JWT) paired with a stateless REST API architecture enables rapid dynamic horizontal scaling. Pair this architecture with containerized deployments with tools such as Docker and you have yourself a trend that isn\u2019t stopping.\r\nIn this presentation, Travis Tidwell, will walk you through the evolution of the web and how we got to where we are today. We will deep dive into the architectures of current technology stacks and discuss why they must adapt to handle the next generation of the web.
